  <h2>Anecdotal evidence that cookies are important:</h2>

    <p>A woman was waiting at an airport for her hours long flight. Since her flight was delayed, she had several hours on her hand. So, she went to airport shops and bought a book and bag of cookies. She took a seat next to a man and started to read the book she had bought. While she was engrossed in her book, she happened to see, that the man sitting beside her boldly grabbed a cookie from the cookie bag. She ignored the incident to avoid a scene.</p>

    <p>She muched some cookies from the bag and went back to her book. But the man seemed to have enjoyed the cookies way too much, he took some more cookies from the bag and started munching it.By the passing time she was getting more and more irritated as the cookie thief finished her cookie stock. Everey time she took a cookie from the bag, he took one. When the last cookies was left, the man nervously took that cookie and broke it in half . he offered the other half to the lady and smiled. The lady snatched the other half of the cookie from his and thought, “this guy has some nerve that even after eating a half bag of my cookies, he didn't show any gratitude.”</p>

    <p>She had been so galled by the man, and was relieved when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate. She boarded the plane and sat in her seat reading her book. She reached her hand in her baggage, she was surprised to find a bag full of cookies in it.If my cookies are here, she moaned in despair, the other one which she was eating from were his, and he tried to share. While she was flushed with anger about her cookies , the man was happily sharing his cookie with her. She was filled with the feeling of guilt and regret. But, It was too late to apologize.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>

    <li>¾ cup brown sugar
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
    <li>½ cup white sugar
    <li>1 teaspoon salt
    <li>1 large egg
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    <li>1 ½cups all-purpose flour 
    <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda
    <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips
    <li>1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks
    <li>3 tablespoons white chocolate chips

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.</li><br>
    <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li><br>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.</li><br>
    <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.</li><br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.</li>
