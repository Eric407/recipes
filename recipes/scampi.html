<h2>Bribery</h2>

    <p>If you want me to show up to a location or perform an arduous task, casually slip in the fact there will be <em>garlicky seafood </em>there. <strong>I will show up.</strong></p>

    <p><em>Hey dude, want to help me move next Saturday? My new spot is a six floor walk-up without A.C. There will be linguine alle vongole. </em> Yes. Sounds great! I'll be there.</p>

    <p><em>Hey dude, I need to give my dog it's new medication, and it's really a two person job. Will you come assist me in the procedure? Im making some steamed mussels in a garlicky tomato sauce.</em> Of course! It would be <strong>my pleasure </strong>to hold down your hundred pound Doberman while you attempt to get it to swallow pills.</p>

    <p><em>Hey dude, I have to drive my Great Aunt Bertha to my Mom's house in Ohio. The speakers in my car don't work, but it's a quick six hour drive. And she doesn't really yell that much. I made some <strong><em>shrimp scampi </em></strong>for the road. Packed it all up in Tupperware. And Great Aunt Bertha is bringing some crispy bread for dipping. Will you come to keep me company?</em>Wow. Really? When do we leave? I am <strong>DOWN.</strong></p>

    
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>

    <li>¼ cup flour</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>24 large shrimp in shell (21 to 25 per lb), peeled and deveined</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot</li>
    <li>1 large clove garlic, pressed</li>
    <li>½ cup Chardonnay wine</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>½ cup butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated Romano cheese</li>

</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Place the flour on a rimmed plate, and season with salt and pepper. Toss the shrimp in the flour, and shake off excess. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the shrimp until pink, about 2 minutes per side. Remove shrimp from skillet, and reserve.</li><br>
    <li>Discard all but 1 tablespoon oil from the skillet. Cook the shallots and garlic in the oil until soft, about 2 minutes. Pour in the wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and the lemon juice. Simmer for about 5 minutes, or until reduced to about 3/4 cup. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of chicken broth and the cream, and simmer until sauce is reduced and thickened slightly, approximately 10 minutes more. Add the butter, and stir until melted.</li><br>
    <li>Return the shrimp to the skillet; simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the parsley and Romano cheese before serving.</li><br>
